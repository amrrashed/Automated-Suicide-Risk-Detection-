Facial Image Analysis for Automated Suicide Risk Detection
This repository contains code for the research project "Facial Image Analysis for Automated Suicide Risk Detection using Deep Neural Networks," as described in the study by Amr E. Eldin Rashed et al., 2024.
The project explores an innovative approach to suicide risk assessment through facial image analysis, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, including EfficientNetb0 and ResNet architectures, enhanced by Bayesian optimization.
The models are further interpreted using GRADCAM, Occlusion Sensitivity, and LIME, offering a non-intrusive, accessible alternative for early detection and intervention in mental health care. 
The method demonstrates significant potential, achieving up to 76.6% accuracy in detecting suicidal behavior using social media profile images.
