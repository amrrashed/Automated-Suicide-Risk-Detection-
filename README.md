abstract 
Suicide is a pressing global issue, particularly among young people, ranking as the second leading cause of death for those aged 15-29. This study focuses on predicting suicidal risk behavior through facial expression analysis. We compile a novel and diverse dataset comprising 319 social media images, categorized into two versions. Our innovative Suicidal Visual Indicators Prediction (SVIP) Framework comprises three phases, with a strong emphasis on preprocessing. The first phase evaluates twelve pre-trained models with ADAM and RMSPROP optimizers, leading to accurate predictions. We adopt techniques like occlusion specificity, Grad-CAM, and Lime to enhance output understanding, eliminate manual hyperparameter tuning, and improve feature extraction. In the second phase, we select the best-performing deep learning networks for feature extraction and integrate AutoML techniques such as Lazypredict, Orange, and TPOT to expedite model generation and fine-tuning, ensuring accurate predictions. The third phase includes feature selection, machine learning model ranking, and hyperparameter optimization. Rigorous evaluation ensures our models meet the highest standards for suicide risk detection. Notably, through Bayesian optimization applied to the SVM model using ResNet18, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 76.6%. It's crucial to emphasize the originality of our research, addressing the rarity of studies in suicide detection through facial analysis and highlighting the limited existing literature on this subject, which makes our work a pioneering and significant contribution to the field.
